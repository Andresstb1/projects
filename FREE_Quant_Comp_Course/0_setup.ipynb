    "    <li>\n",
    "      <strong>Gate and readout errors:</strong> Every quantum gate operation and measurement introduces \n",
    "      a small probability of error. The longer and more complex your circuit, the more these errors accumulate.\n",

    "    <li>\n",
    "      <strong>Limited qubit connectivity:</strong> Not all qubits can interact directly. \n",
    "      Some operations require additional gates (like SWAPs), which further increase the total error rate.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "      <strong>Job queue times:</strong> IBM Quantum devices are shared by many users worldwide. \n",
    "      Depending on demand, your circuit may take from seconds to minutes (or even longer) to execute.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "      <strong>Execution limits:</strong> Free IBM Quantum accounts have a limit on the number of shots (repetitions) \n",
    "      and the number of jobs that can be submitted in a given time period.\n",

    "    <li>\n",
